# github-comment-view-source

> A userscript to view the source of a comment on GitHub

Adds a `View source` button to the 3-dot menu on comments on GitHub. This applies to comments on issues and pull requests as well as the main issue/pull request description.

You will be asked for a Personal Access Token the first time you view a supported page. This is required to access the GitHub API to fetch the source of the comment. The token is stored in your user script managers's storage and is only used to make requests to the GitHub API. It is not sent to any third-party servers.
